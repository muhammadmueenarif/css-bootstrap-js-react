we have already learned css and js. now we will focus on bootstrap and react. 

Lec 01. Bootstrap Environment Setup
Bootstrap packages include  scaffolding, components, css, js plugins. 

scaffolding means we will get number of folders differently for css, for js in the different folders 
so that we can pickup particular concept from scaffolded folder. 

components means if we want to use icon in a button or giph icons. 
js plugins helps us in making rapid app development. 

goto bootstrap website and setup Environment. we can setup using cdn links, download source code or 
download css and js files.

Lec 02. Bootstrap Forms
form-group class to div. means all things in it will be logically bound together. So whenever we will apply some
changes in this div that will be applicable for all the controls inside this form group.
So logically which controls are doing the similar task we will enclose them inside a group.

form-control class in input. makes input responsive. 

form-inline class to form. it will align in single line. form-inline class is not applicable in Bootstrap 5.
we can use the d-flex and flex-wrap classes to achieve the same effect.
